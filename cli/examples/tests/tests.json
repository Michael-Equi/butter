Two quick questions:\nWould you recommend writing the script as a separate file in scripts dir and calling it via subprocess, or writing it as a function within wf/__init__.py?\nHow do I read LatchFile objects as strings, line by line?",

I was running it with 8 cores and 50GB of memory and i received an error in R that seemed I had insufficient RAM to run our analysis. So I increased to 16 Cores to troubleshoot but now I can no longer start Rstudio. Do I need to start a new pod if I want to switch the cores midway? Also will the installed libraries be maintained between different pods?",

Any recommendations?  Can I switch off the retries?",
