With Pods, you can:\nIn this tutorial, we will learn:\nAfter the tutorial, you will have your personal computing environment on Latch to start performing custom analyses.\n### How to create and start using Pods\nTo create a new Pod, click the Apps dropdown and select \u201cCreate a new Pod\u201d. You will be prompted to enter a Pod name and set up your personal computing environment.\n### How to choose the right compute sizes\nThere are four Pod sizes that you can choose from: 4 cores and 8GiB of RAM, 8 cores and 32 GiB of RAM, 16 cores and 128 GiB of RAM, and 64 cores and 256GiB of RAM. Storage for a Pod ranges from 20 to 1000 gigabytes.\u00a0 For most use cases, the first option should be sufficient.\nIf you want to use GitHub inside Pod or access Pod from the terminal of your personal computer, continue with the advanced steps below. Otherwise, click \u201cLaunch Pod\u201d.\nNote: Pods may take 5-15 minutes to start running.\n\n## Developer Environment:\n\n### RStudio & JupyterLab\nOnce a Pod has started, RStudio and JupyterLab will be available by default in your Pod. To access them, simply double click on the desired notebook, and copy paste the permanent endpoints from the sidebar.\nVoila! Now, you will be able to open up Jupyter Labs or RStudio for downstream analyses.\n### Remote Development\nYou can program with your favorite IDE, such as VSCode and Pycharm, and open them inside a running Pod to take full advantage of the Pod\u2019s powerful computing environment.\n### VSCode\n\n## Common Errors when using Pods:\n\n### I can\u2019t connect to Pods via SSH.\nkex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host\nError: Permission denied (publickey)\n### I want to manually add additional SSH keys to an existing Pod.\n### I can\u2019t open RStudio or Jupyter Labs.\nYour Pod and notebooks have not fully started yet.\nIf a new tab opens but takes a long time to load and you get a 502 Gateway Error, try stoping and starting the Pod to refresh the connection.\nDid you run into any errors that were not listed here?

With Pods, you can:\nIn this tutorial, we will learn:\nAfter the tutorial, you will have your personal computing environment on Latch to start performing custom analyses.\n### How to create and start using Pods\nTo create a new Pod, click the Apps dropdown and select \u201cCreate a new Pod\u201d. You will be prompted to enter a Pod name and set up your personal computing environment.\n### How to choose the right compute sizes\nThere are four Pod sizes that you can choose from: 4 cores and 8GiB of RAM, 8 cores and 32 GiB of RAM, 16 cores and 128 GiB of RAM, and 64 cores and 256GiB of RAM. Storage for a Pod ranges from 20 to 1000 gigabytes.\u00a0 For most use cases, the first option should be sufficient.\nIf you want to use GitHub inside Pod or access Pod from the terminal of your personal computer, continue with the advanced steps below. Otherwise, click \u201cLaunch Pod\u201d.\nNote: Pods may take 5-15 minutes to start running.\n\n## Developer Environment:\n\n### RStudio & JupyterLab\nOnce a Pod has started, RStudio and JupyterLab will be available by default in your Pod. To access them, simply double click on the desired notebook, and copy paste the permanent endpoints from the sidebar.\nVoila! Now, you will be able to open up Jupyter Labs or RStudio for downstream analyses.\n### Remote Development\nYou can program with your favorite IDE, such as VSCode and Pycharm, and open them inside a running Pod to take full advantage of the Pod\u2019s powerful computing environment.\n### VSCode\n\n## Common Errors when using Pods:\n\n### I can\u2019t connect to Pods via SSH.\nkex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host\nError: Permission denied (publickey)\n### I want to manually add additional SSH keys to an existing Pod.\n### I can\u2019t open RStudio or Jupyter Labs.\nYour Pod and notebooks have not fully started yet.\nIf a new tab opens but takes a long time to load and you get a 502 Gateway Error, try stoping and starting the Pod to refresh the connection.\nDid you run into any errors that were not listed here?

You will be prompted to enter a Pod name and set up your personal computing environment.\n### How to choose the right compute sizes\nThere are four Pod sizes that you can choose from: 4 cores and 8GiB of RAM, 8 cores and 32 GiB of RAM, 16 cores and 128 GiB of RAM, and 64 cores and 256GiB of RAM. Storage for a Pod ranges from 20 to 1000 gigabytes.\u00a0 For most use cases, the first option should be sufficient.\nIf you want to use GitHub inside Pod or access Pod from the terminal of your personal computer, continue with the advanced steps below. Otherwise, click \u201cLaunch Pod\u201d.\nNote: Pods may take 5-15 minutes to start running.\n\n## Developer Environment:\n\n### RStudio & JupyterLab\nOnce a Pod has started, RStudio and JupyterLab will be available by default in your Pod. To access them, simply double click on the desired notebook, and copy paste the permanent endpoints from the sidebar.\nVoila! Now, you will be able to open up Jupyter Labs or RStudio for downstream analyses.\n### Remote Development\nYou can program with your favorite IDE, such as VSCode and Pycharm, and open them inside a running Pod to take full advantage of the Pod\u2019s powerful computing environment.\n### VSCode\n\n## Common Errors when using Pods:\n\n### I can\u2019t connect to Pods via SSH.\nkex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host\nError: Permission denied (publickey)\n### I want to manually add additional SSH keys to an existing Pod.\n### I can\u2019t open RStudio or Jupyter Labs.\nYour Pod and notebooks have not fully started yet.\nIf a new tab opens but takes a long time to load and you get a 502 Gateway Error, try stoping and starting the Pod to refresh the connection.\nDid you run into any errors that were not listed here?
